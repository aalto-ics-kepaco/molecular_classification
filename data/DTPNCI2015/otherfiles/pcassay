90. NCI AIDS Antiviral Assay [Confirmatory]
The ability of compounds to protect human CEM cells from HIV-1 infection is measured as a screen for new compounds capable of inhibiting the HIV virus. Five concentrations of drug were tested on uninfected and infected cells and cell growth was measured using a soluble formazan assay. The dose response curve for the uninfected cells was used to calculate an IC50, the concentration of drug that causes 50% inhibition of growth (a measure of toxicity). The dose respose curve for the infected cells was used to calculate an EC50, the concentration of drug that provides 50% protection from the growth inhibition caused by the HIV virus. Compounds that provided at least 50% protection were retested. Compounds that provided at least 50% protection on retest were listed as moderately active. Compounds that reproducibly provided 100% protection were listed as confirmed active. COmpounds not meeting these criteria were listed as confirmed inactive. Note that the inability to provide protection could be due to toxicity.
