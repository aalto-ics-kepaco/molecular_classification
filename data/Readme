-. Take a look at http://dtp.cancer.gov/index.html to get a brief view of the drug screen project.
-. Either process the data by your own scripts or follow the scripts and instruction. The goad here is to better understand the structure of the data source and to validate the processed data.
        -. Go to http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pcassay and search with keywords 'DTP/NCI'
        -. Download the list of cellline AIDs that correspond to the celllines in DTP/NCI project and save AIDs to file ./otherfiles/pcassay
        -. For each cellline, download its data file from ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubchem/Bioassay/CSV/Data/0000001_0001000.zip according to its AID. This will be a zip file covers all cellline data files in DTP/NCI project. 
        -. Each cellline data file will contain a list of compounds with their test activities in this cellline.
        -. Parse the cellline data file to extract the data we need which is a m by k matrix of activity scores of m molecules in k celllines.
        -. Save the processed data to activity_complete

-. So far, we have around 40,000 molecules with their activities in about 70 cell lines. There exist two problems with this data matrix in the file:./activity.txt which we should tackle.
-. The first problem is that we still need structural information for molecules, based on which we can measure the similaries with e.g. kernel methods.
        -. The structural information of molecules are in the folder:./molecular_structures, where there are two types of structural information for molecules, namely, SDF files and SMI strings. 
        -. Note that we may not have a complete set of structures. Therefore, we need to filter the activity matrix against the set of molecular structures available in the folder.
-. The second problem is that the activity score matrix in the file:activity_complete is not complete. In other words, there area many entries with missing value. This is problemetic during learning in the later phase.
        -. To tackle the second problem, we will organize the score matrix such that the complete information will appear in the upper left block of the whole matrix.
        -. We are given a set of 60 cancer cell lines in the file:otherfiles/id2aid2names. These cell lines are the ones with additional information e.g. in cell miner (http://discover.nci.nih.gov/cellminer/home.do).
        -. First, we organize the score matrix such that the first 60 columns will correspond to these 60 cell lines, and the rest will follow. In particular, we have column structure as 60 + 13. 
        -. Then we organize the rows of the score matrix such that the first ~4000 rows will correspond to the molecules that have complete data in these 60 cell lines. The rest will follow.
-. We notice that the activity score is computed by -10*log(GI50). We still need binary value as the activity outcome for classification. According to NCBI, a molecule is 'active' if the activity score is over(>=) 60 and 'inactive' otherwise.
