-. Take a look at http://dtp.cancer.gov/index.html to get a brief view of the drug screen project.
-. Either process the data by your own scripts or follow the scripts and instruction. The goad here is to better understand the structure of the data source and to validate the processed data.
        -. Go to http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pcassay and search with keywords 'DTP/NCI'
        -. Download the list of cellline AIDs that correspond to the celllines in DTP/NCI project and save AIDs to file ./otherfiles/pcassay
        -. For each cellline, download its data file from ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubchem/Bioassay/CSV/Data/0000001_0001000.zip according to its AID. This will be a zip file covers all cellline data files in DTP/NCI project. 
        -. Each cellline data file will contain a list of compounds with their test activities in this cellline.
        -. Parse the cellline data file to extract the data we need which is a m by k matrix of activity scores of m molecules in k celllines.
        -. Save the processed data to activity_complete
-. So far, we have around 40,000 molecules with their activities in about 70 celllines. There exist two problems with this data matrix in activity.txt which we should care about.
-. The first problem is that we still need structural information for molecules, based on which we can measure the similaries between molecules (e.g. with kernel methdos).
        -. The structural information of molecules are in ./molecular_structures, where there are two types of structural information for molecules, namely, sdf files and smi strings. 
        -. Note that we may not have a complete set of structures. Therefore, we need to filter the activity matrix against the set of available molecular structures.
-. The second problem is that the acticity score matrix in activity_complete is not complete. In other words, there are many entries with missing value. 
        -. To tackle this problem, we are given a set of 60 cancer cell lines given in otherfiles/id2aid/names.
        -. We need to filter the activity matrix, column in particular, against the known cell lines. As a results, we reduce the cell lines from 73 to 60.
        -. We also need to filter row of the matrix in which we remove the molecule that does not have a complete activities in all 60 cell lines.
